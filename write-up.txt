This project need to build a binary classification model. 

There are four steps for build this model: data exploration, feature engineering and data cleaning, building baseline and ML models, and model evaluation. 

Next step: model implementation (big data or on-time), model monitoring, and model retrain.

This model is a starting point but need more models to work together, such as model can detect the missing fraudulent transaction from this model or the model checking for some big transactions.
